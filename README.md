# EDA-on-Income-Analysis
üßÆ Exploratory Data Analysis on Indian Census Dataset
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Census dataset to uncover insights into population demographics, income distribution, literacy, household facilities, and more across various districts and states.

üîç What I Did:
Cleaned and Prepared the Dataset
Identified and resolved issues like incorrect or inconsistent column names (e.g., 'State name' vs 'State Name') and ensured data types were appropriate for analysis.

Analyzed Income Distribution
Focused on columns like Power_Parity_Above_Rs_545000 and other income bands to understand the distribution of higher-income households across districts.

State-wise Aggregation and Visualization
Grouped the data by State Name and visualized how higher income populations are distributed geographically using bar plots.

Created Visualizations Using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Used histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps to visually explore the data and reveal patterns in household wealth, education levels, and amenities.

Explored Other Demographics
Looked into literacy, employment, and household assets such as access to electricity, internet, vehicles, and sanitation.
